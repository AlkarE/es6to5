## es6-boilerplate

ES6 Boilerplate allows you to use features from the next version of javascript (es6) today, and transpile them to the
current version of javascript (es5) so they run in all browsers.  ES6 modules, AMD modules and global scripts
and libraries all work together, and can be easily built, concatentated, minified, and gzipped along with source
maps to allow you to debug in production while delivering high performance to your users.
